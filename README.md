**What is Docker You Ask?**

**Ya, me too**

But according to the bountiful information on the web, Docker is a computer program that performs operating-system-level-virtualization.

Docker runs software packages called Containers. Containers are isolated from each other and bundle their own applications, tools, libraries and configuration files. They can communicate with each other through well-defined channels. All containers are run by a single operatiing-system kernel which makes the software lightweight and more appealing then running devices on local machines.

For those who are more visual and enjoy a somewhat accurate comparison. Docker is like the United States, each state is it's only container that have different laws (dependencies, libraries, configurations) but still run under one overlaying government(the FEDS). 

**Benefits to Docker**

- Taking away that time old excuse all developers use, "But It Works on my computer"
- Reducing infrastructure costs
- Standardization and Productivity
- Compatibility and Maintainability
- Rapid Deployment
- Continuous Deployment and Testing
and so on.......
